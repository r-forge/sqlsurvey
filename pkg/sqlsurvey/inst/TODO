- adding variables to a design, while keeping call-by-value.  Started, in svymean.sqlsurvey, sqlmodelmatrix, subset.sqlsurvey
? lasso
- booleans aren't handled right by RMonetDB: converted to character on the way in, but not converted back on the way out. MonetR may fix this.


replicate-weight designs
