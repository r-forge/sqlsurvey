0.4-3 allow linearisation variances without any strata.

0.4-1 faster svyquantile using random sample to start.

    svyquantile drops missing observations

    better approach to subsets for replicate-weights.

    svyloglin() method for sqlrepsurvey

    svylm() works with MonetDB's flavour of SQL.

    svychisq() for Rao-Scott tests (via svyloglin)

    simple expressions can be used: eg, ~I(relp %in% 0:15)

    ~cut(x,breaks) can be used.

0.4 Renamed to sqlsurvey.

    Added support for replicate weights

    switched to JDBC and MonetDB rather than SQLite

0.3 faster creation from existing SQLite database

    added sqlocpoly for smoothing and density estimation

    added sqlhexbin
    
    open.sqlsurvey() now checks for the existence of the file

    sqlsubst() allows (and ignores) NULL replacement values


0.2 added svylm

    allowed sampling with replacement

0.1  Initial version
