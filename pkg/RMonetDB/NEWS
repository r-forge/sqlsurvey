0.3-1	add monet.read.csv to read CSV files without going via R.

0.3-0   Fork to RMonetDB by modifying dbSendUpdate to use .createStatement
        rather than .prepareStatement when there are no parameters.
  	Apparently needed for MonetDB:JDBC to work.

    *	use Java code to fetch results -- it should result in much higher
	throughput in pulling result sets from the database. It is
	also more efficient to use fetch() with n specified
	(especially if you know it in advance) than relying on
	n = -1. The latter will try first run with n = 32k and then
	continue with n = 512k chunks and paste the results which is
	inherently slow (still much faster than the 0.1-x way which
	was fetching one record at a time).


0.1-6	2011-03-09
    *	fix a typo in dbClearResult

    *	map NAs in query parameters into NULLs
	(thanks to Axel Klenk)

    *	explicitly close statements right away (Oracle seems to need this)
	(thanks to Axel Klenk)

    *	add "stat" slot (Statement object) to JDBCResult class to make sure
	the statement lives long enough to not close the result set

    *	convert NULLs into NAs in numeric columns

0.1-5	2007-10-01
    *	instantiate driver's class and use a call to 'connect' as a
	fall-back if the DriverManager fails to find a proper driver.

    *	fix SQL syntax in dbWriteTable (superfluous semicolon)

    *	fix a typo in prepared statement code
	(thanks to Carl Grant for the last two bugfixes)

0.1-4	2007-03-05
    *	added SQL error information to most JDBC errors

    *	use .jfindClass to load drivers

0.1-3	2007-02-21
    *	remove beforeFirst() as some DBMS don't like it. This also
	allows a sequential use of fetch() with a limit to load data
	in chunks.

    *	fix a bug that caused NULL entries in string columns to fail
	in fetch()

0.1-2	2007-01-23
    *	fix dbDisconnect return value and update manuals

0.1-1	2007-01-17
    *	added pre-compiled statements and proper dbWriteTable

0.1-0	(not released)
    *	drop pgsql access, switch to DBI

0.0-3	2006-03-05
    *	add direct insert support for pgsql

0.0-2	2005-10-12
    *	added converson of tables to data.frames

0.0-1	2005-05-02
    *	added type conversion (int, double, string)

0.0-0	2004-11-02
    *	first public release
